# React Quiz App

Welcome to the **React Quiz App**! This application is a fun and interactive quiz platform built using **React** with a focus on state management via the `useReducer` hook. The app features a pointing system, a high score tracker, and a timer that automatically stops the quiz when the time runs out. Additionally, the app utilizes a fake API with `json-server` for handling quiz data.
